Figure 1 – Subnet Expansion Without Downtime

---

## Why Expand a Subnet?

As more VM instances are created, a subnet may eventually exhaust its available IP addresses.

Google Cloud allows administrators to expand a subnet's CIDR range without shutting down running workloads.

---

## Initial Configuration

| Setting       | Value         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Network Type  | Custom VPC    |
| Original CIDR | `10.0.0.0/29` |
| Running VMs   | 4             |
| Available IPs | Exhausted     |

A `/29` subnet contains 8 total IP addresses.

Google Cloud reserves 4 addresses, leaving only 4 usable IP addresses for VM instances.
---

## Demonstration

The instructor attempted to create a fifth VM.

Result:
```
VM5
    ↓
IP space exhausted
```
-Attempting to create a fifth VM fails because no IP addresses remain. 
-In other words, the deployment failed because every usable IP address had already been assigned.

Error:

```
IP space exhausted
```

---

## Expanding the Subnet

The subnet is edited from:

```
10.0.0.0/29
```

to

```
10.0.0.0/23
```

The change completes while all existing VM instances remain online.

During the expansion:

- VM1 remained online
- VM2 remained online
- VM3 remained online
- VM4 remained online

No VM restart occurred.

No downtime occurred.

---

## Result

After the subnet expansion:

- Existing workloads continued running.
- The subnet immediately had additional IP addresses.
- VM5 was successfully created using the newly available address space.

---

# Key Concepts

- Google Cloud supports live subnet expansion.
- Existing VM instances remain online during expansion.
- Expanding a subnet does not require VM restarts.
- Expanded CIDR ranges must not overlap other subnet ranges within the VPC.
- CIDR expansion is one-way. In that, Subnet expansion cannot be reversed.
- The new subnet range must be larger than the original range.

---

# ACE Exam Notes

✔ Custom VPC networks allow subnet expansion.

✔ Existing workloads remain online.

✔ No VM downtime is required.

✔ New subnet ranges cannot overlap existing subnet ranges.

✔ CIDR expansion cannot be reversed.

✔ Larger subnet = More available VM IP addresses.

```

```

After

```

VM5 ✔ (after subnet expansion)
```

## Takeaway

> **Key Point**
>
> Google Cloud supports **live subnet expansion**, allowing administrators to increase available IP addresses **without restarting existing VM instances or causing downtime**. After the expansion completes, new VM deployments can immediately use the additional IP address space.
